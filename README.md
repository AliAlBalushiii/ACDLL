*This project represents my first attempt at developing an internal DLL injection for the game **Assault Cube** (version **1.3.0.2**).*

⚠️ **Note:** The project was not completed, as I later realized that DLL injection can be easily detected by anti-cheat systems.  
For this reason, I decided to discontinue development and shift my focus toward external cheats with kernel-level techniques.
